# Neighbor
	I'm sorry to hear you lost **Spund**, I hope you find him again.

Cats always get stuck in the strangest of places don't they?

# Townsperson
	Have I seen your cat? Spund?
	...
	I'm afraid not, sorry.

# Rock Climber
	Need some help?
	You won't get very far without a *Climbing Kit*
	Here, you can use mine.

Go on, try scaling that wall there, you got this!

# Wizard
	Pesky ghosts!
	Oh, hello. Are the ghosts haunting you as well?
	Here, drink this.
	Now you can fight back by pressing "[fire key]"

Careful, that potion is quite powerful.

# Farmer
	Too far to reach? Hm...
	Oh! I have a *Ladder* you can borrow, 
	but you'll need to defeat some snails in my garden first.

You'd better fetch the ladder before the snails do!


# Rock Climber
	Stuck again?
	Try these *Spring Shoes*, they might help you gain some height.

Jumping around is fun, isn't it?

# Spund
	Mew.
	Meoww
	Mreoww!
	Meeowww
	MNYeAEaEWr!
