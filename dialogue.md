# Townsperson
	Too far to reach? Hm...
	Oh! I have a *Ladder* you can borrow, 
	but you'll need to defeat some snails in my garden first.

You'd better fetch the ladder before the snails do!

# Wizard
	Pesky ghosts!
	Oh, hello. Are the ghosts haunting you as well?
	Here, drink this.
	Now you can fight back by pressing "[fire key]"

Careful, that potion is quite powerful.

# Rock Climber
	Need some help?
	You won't get very far without a *Climbing Kit*
	Here, you can use mine.

Go on, try scaling that wall there, you got this!


# Cat
	Mew.
	Meoww
	Mreoww!
	Meeowww
	MNYeAEaEWr!
